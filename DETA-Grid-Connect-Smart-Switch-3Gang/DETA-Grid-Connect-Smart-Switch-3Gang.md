## General Notes

The DETA [Smart Triple Switch (6903HA)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/deta-grid-connect-smart-triple-gang-touch-light-switch_p0161014) is made by Arlec as part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/), and are sold at Bunnings in Australia and New Zealand.  Note that the 3 Gang switch does NOT work with TUYA Convert at this stage, you will need to revert to a serial based flash. [Flash instructions here](https://blog.mikejmcguire.com/2020/05/22/deta-grid-connect-3-and-4-gang-light-switches-and-home-assistant/)

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin     | Function                           |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| GPIO4   | Status LED *(inverted)*            |
| GPIO16  | Button1, Bottom                    |
| GPIO04  | Button2, Bottom                    |
| GPIO03  | Button3, Bottom                    |
| GPIO05  | Relay1, Top *(includes LED)*       |
| GPIO14  | Relay2, Top *(includes LED)*       |
| GPIO12  | Relay3, Top *(includes LED)*       |

Note that each relay shares a pin with its associated LED; it's not possible to turn either relay on/off independently of its button LED.
The top/bottom designation here assumes that it is installed vertically, with the status LED (group of 6 dots) on the right-hand side.

## Getting it up and running

### Tuya Convert

Doesn't work due to updated protected firmware.

## Advanced Configuration - With timer on Heat and Fan

```yaml
substitutions:
  devicename: esppowderroom
  upper_devicename: Powder Room
  friendly_name: "Powder Room Switch"
  button1_name: "Heat"          ### Left or Top
  button2_name: "Fan"           ### Middle
  button3_name: "Light"         ### Right or Bottom
